# Taiwan Stock & Institutional Capital Dashboard

An interactive, premium-designed financial dashboard built in Python using **Streamlit** and **Plotly**. It visualizes daily stock price trends alongside Taiwan's Three Major Institutional Investors' Net Buy/Sell volume (Foreign Investors, Investment Trust, and Dealers) over a rolling 6-month period for TAIEX and preset/custom stocks in the Taiwan market.

This project is built using a clean **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** to separate data extraction, validation, and fallbacks (in `data_service.py`) from layout rendering and user interactions (in `app.py`).

---

## Features

1. **Clean Object-Oriented Design (OOD)**:
   - High cohesion and low coupling between modules.
   - Core data operations isolated in `data_service.py` using classes: `AssetConfig`, `DataFetcher`, `FallbackGenerator`, and `MarketDataService`.
   - Layout rendering isolated in `app.py` under the `DashboardUI` controller class.
2. **Dynamic & Custom Assets**:
   - TAIEX (Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) is always available as the default view.
   - Support for selecting pre-configured top-weighted stocks (TSMC, Foxconn, MediaTek, Quanta Computer, Fubon Financial).
   - Support for **Custom Stock Input**: Enter any valid numerical stock code (e.g., `2303` or `2303.TW`) to retrieve custom analytics dynamically.
3. **Multi-Institutional Tracking & Dual-Axis Subplots**:
   - **Top Subplot**: Interactive price charts supporting both **Candlestick** and **Line** layouts.
   - **Bottom Subplot**: Interactive volume charts dynamically changing based on the selected investor view.
   - **Summary Mode**: A powerful **Relative Stacked Bar Chart** displaying the individual net flow of Foreign Investors, Investment Trust, and Dealers layered on top of each other, alongside a trend line for the Total Institutional flow.
4. **Key Metric Indicators**: High-level KPI cards displaying the latest closing price, daily changes, daily net capital flows, and cumulative flows for the selected timeframe.
5. **Robust Caching & Rate Limiting**: Implements Streamlit `st.cache_data` (1-hour TTL) and a realistic fallback simulation layer to prevent API blocks or app crashes.
6. **Data Export**: Displays recent transaction records in an interactive table (automatically adapting columns based on the selected investor view) with a direct download button to export the combined datasets as CSV.
